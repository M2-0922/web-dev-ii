###### Arrow Functions:

Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They are similar to regular function expressions, but with a more concise and easier-to-read syntax. Arrow functions are anonymous, which means they don't have a name like regular functions.

```js
let add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

It is equivalent to

```js
let add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

Arrow functions also have a shorter syntax for the function body when it's a single expression:

```js
let double = n => n * 2;
```

It is equivalent to

```js
let double = function(n) {
  return n * 2;
};
```

Arrow functions do not bind their own this value, instead, they inherit the this value of the surrounding scope. This means that you donâ€™t need to use .bind(this) to ensure that the value of this remains the same inside the function.
