The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like hierarchy, with each element of the document (such as a paragraph or an image) being represented as a node in the tree. The DOM allows developers to access and manipulate the elements of a document, including adding, removing, and modifying elements and their attributes. The DOM is often used by JavaScript to dynamically update the contents and layout of a web page in response to user interactions or other events.
