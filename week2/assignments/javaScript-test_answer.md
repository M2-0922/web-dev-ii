Just a quick test to test your javascript understanding.

```js
It is the newer version of JavaScript
```

###### 2- Name 3 examples of ES6 features.

}).catch(function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});
// after this line,

async function getQuote(){
	console.log(quote);
	let result = await(err) => {
		console.log(err);
	}
}

```
  
###### 8- Convert this code to arrow function.

```js
function greeting(firstname, lastname) {
  return `Hello ${firstname} ${lastname}`;
}
// after this line,
const greeting = (firstname, lastname) => {
