HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) defines several methods for making requests to a server. The most common HTTP methods are:

`GET`: Retrieve a resource or a list of resources from the server. This method is used to retrieve data from the server without modifying it.

`POST`: Create a new resource on the server or update an existing resource. This method is used to submit data to the server to be processed.

`PUT`: Update an existing resource on the server. This method replaces the resource entirely with a new version.

`DELETE`: Delete a resource on the server. This method is used to delete a resource from the server.

`HEAD`: Retrieve only the headers of a resource, without its body. This method is used to retrieve only the metadata of a resource.

`PATCH`: Partially update an existing resource on the server. This method is used to update specific fields of a resource, rather than replacing the entire resource.

`OPTIONS`: Retrieve the available methods for a resource. This method is used to retrieve the available methods for a resource, such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.

These methods define the type of action to be performed on the resource specified in the request URL. The choice of method depends on the purpose of the request, and the server's implementation.
