AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages by exchanging small amounts of data with the server, without reloading the entire page.

Here's an example of an AJAX request using XMLHttpRequest in JavaScript:

```js
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data", true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    console.log(data);
  }
};
xhr.send();
```
This code creates a new `XMLHttpRequest` object, opens a GET request to `https://api.example.com/data`, sets the `onreadystatechange` function to handle the response, and sends the request. The function checks if the request is complete and successful, then parses the response as JSON and logs it to the console.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used for making asynchronous HTTP requests to a server from a web page. This allows you to update a web page without having to reload the entire page.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a set of protocols and routines for building software applications. They specify how software components should interact with each other.

In the context of web development, an API is a set of endpoints provided by a server that can be used to retrieve or manipulate data. For example, a weather API might have an endpoint that returns the current temperature for a given city.

When making AJAX requests to an API, you can use JavaScript to send an HTTP request to the API and retrieve the data it returns. The response from the API is usually in the form of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, which can be easily parsed and used in your web page.

Here's an example of using AJAX to retrieve data from an API:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In this example, the fetch function is used to send an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint. The response from the API is converted to a JavaScript object using `response.json()` and the resulting data is logged to the console. If an error occurs, it is caught and logged to the console using `catch`.
